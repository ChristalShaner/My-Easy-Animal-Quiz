# My-Easy-Animal-Quiz
This is my first Python project on GitHub! 
In it, you will find an interesting set of questions asking about various wildlife! Have fun!

I began teaching myself Python3 about a year ago. I became drawn to the simplicity of it. 

I am a nature person and of the au natural aesthetic. 
Any opportunity I can get to mesh together tech and the natural world I take. 

This project is a simple point-based game that allows you to guess the answer to a question up to three times.
Some of the questions are tricky, but you won't find any answers here!
This is my first Python3 project, and I loved it. I enjoy using tech to teach people new things.
The loops are simple, the if-else statements are concise, and it flows wonderfully.

This code can be run on virtually any application, including Visual Studio, XCode, and other online Python3 compilers.

If you encounter any issues with running the code, please let me know! Thank you for reading!
